# Depth-Fish
## Sequence of files to run:

 ### Data and models 
 - prepare_data.R: loads and grooms data, saves for models and plots.
 - run_models.R: attention - runs all models, may over-write existing files!
 
 ### Figures:
 - pop_effect_figs.R: figures for population level effects
 - depth_dens_plot.R: Figure 2
 - slope_dens_plot.R: same as Fig 2, but with slope
 - proba_of_increase_plot.R: Different options for plotting proba of increase
 - proba_of_increase_slope.R: Proba of increase (not changed)
 - ternery_plot.R: ternary variance partitioning
 
 - plot_opts.R: global plotting options
 
 ### Tables
 
 # TABLE 1: proba of increase by trophic group, depth bin and pop status
 # TABLE 2: proba that density increases more rapidly with depth at populated islands relative to unpopulated islands, by trophic group and depth bin
